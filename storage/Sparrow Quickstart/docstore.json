You'll start by learning what Sparrow is, then look at what's in your Sparrow Development Kit box, and finally get everything up and running.\n\nWhat is Sparrow?\n\nSparrow is a set of reference designs that enable one or more Nodes to communicate with a paired Gateway using a LoRa radio. That gateway, in turn, can then communicate with the cloud over Wi-Fi or cellular.\n\nThis architecture allows you to add cloud connectivity to a local cluster of devices while keeping per-device costs as low as possible.\n\nThis quickstart covers getting started with a Sparrow Development Kit, which contains a set of hardware that implements the Sparrow architecture as shown in the diagram below.\n\nTo understand how everything fits together, let's next look at the specific pieces of Sparrow hardware.\n\nWhat is in the Box\n\nYour Sparrow Developer Kit contains the items shown below. Let's quickly define what each of these items are before discussing how to hook everything up.\n\n1. Notecarrier-A with a pre-installed Wi-Fi Notecard\n\nThe Wi-Fi Notecard is a System-on-Module that makes it easy to send data over a Wi-Fi network. The Notecarrier-A is a companion board that houses the Notecard.\n\n2. Essentials Board\n\nA microcontroller that acts as the radio that performs the LoRa-based communication with the Sparrow Reference Nodes. The Essentials board also provides connectors for power (Lipo and coin cell) and external sensors with Qwiic and female headers.\n\n3. Reference Nodes\n\nEnclosed boards that include a temperature/humidity sensor, a PIR motion sensor, and a dual-AAA-battery holder for power.\n\n4.

Female-to-Female JST SH (Qwiic) connector\n\nA Qwiic JST connector you'll use to attach the Essentials Board to the Notecarrier-A.\n\n5. STLINK-V3MINI\n\nA stand-alone debugging probe for STM32 microcontrollers. You can use this to debug and update firmware on both the Essentials Board and Reference Nodes\n\nSetting Up Your Hardware\n\nNow that you know what you're working with, let's look at the steps you need to take to get your hardware up and running.\n\nRemove the four screws from the back of each of the two Reference Node enclosures, and insert two AAA batteries in each. Leave the backs of the enclosures off for now.\n\nConnect your Essentials Board to your Notecarrier-A using the included Qwiic cable.\n\nEnsure the DIP switch on the Notecarrier-A is set to 3V3, as 3V3 is a requirement when using a Wi-Fi Notecard.\n\n{\" \"}\n\nNote\nThe end of a safety pin works well for flipping DIP switches.\n\nEnsure the DIP switches on the Essentials Board are all set to OFF\u2014aka ensure the switches point towards the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and not ON.\n\nNote\n\nThe DIP switches on the Essentials Board control the frequency on which Sparrow operates. Sparrow uses the LoRa protocol, and operates on the ISM (industrial, scientific, medical) band, which allows anyone to transmit without the need for a license, permit, or transmission rights. Unfortunately, the ISM band is not standardized globally, so the frequency of the Sparrow must be set to operate the region in which it is being used.\n\nWe recommend all Sparrow users start with the DIP switches set to off during your initial testing. For legal operation in the United States and Canada, the Sparrow DIP switches MUST remain OFF on all boards.

A ProductUID is the unique identifier you will use to associate a Notecard to a Notehub Project, and ensure that data from the Notecard ends up in the right location.\n\nTo set up Notehub complete the following steps.\n\nNavigate to Notehub at notehub.io, and create a new account if you haven't already.\n\nOnce you're on the Notehub dashboard, click the Create Project button.\n\nGive the project a Project Name, and then click the Create Project button.\n\nNOTE: The ProductUID must be globally unique.", "start_char_idx": 3428, "end_char_idx": 5269, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a8621fb3-4308-496a-bf1f-b6de3985747f": {"__data__": {"id_": "a8621fb3-4308-496a-bf1f-b6de3985747f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "", "category": "Sparrow Quickstart", "url": "https://dev.blues.io/quickstart/sparrow-quickstart/"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0160d4a5-478c-412c-8132-8e2a29e7cf3c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"title": "", "category": "Sparrow Quickstart", "url": "https://dev.blues.io/quickstart/sparrow-quickstart/"}, "hash": "a57fe818be2e618c4aa3358710ae560d84d9f513db397531b40bc9b6cfee997b"}, "2": {"node_id": "91926be0-d063-4891-afe2-4d0f663ea301", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"title": "", "category": "Sparrow Quickstart", "url": "https://dev.blues.io/quickstart/sparrow-quickstart/"}, "hash": "ceb061e4c1fa8c4880f43fe90979fdf1a29de19a2a6936d5e41cde7b1c16fa4a"}, "3": {"node_id": "7d676ade-167f-42b8-907b-2eb17c51ce17", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"title": "", "category": "Sparrow Quickstart", "url": "https://dev.blues.io/quickstart/sparrow-quickstart/"}, "hash": "46cece31c7c85e2cd4018fa81466e25b82ff5df598357864686dd68322cde64f"}}, "hash": "17088c480dca6513918d3b13618db7d03724f36f8f100ad1233cf07d69de1e04", "text": "click the Create Project button.\n\nNOTE: The ProductUID must be globally unique. To reduce collisions, Notehub prepends a generated namespace based on your account email, for instance com.your-company.your-name:.

Your next step is to associate your hardware with your new cloud backend.\n\nSet Up Notecard\n\nIn this part of the exercise you'll configure your Notecard so that it knows where to send data. You do this by assigning the ProductUID created in the last step to your Notecard.\n\nSetting the ProductUID associates a Notecard to a given Project in Notehub.

If all went well, your Reference Nodes should already be collecting data, sending that data to your gateway via LoRa, and your gateway should be sending that data to your Notehub project.\n\nLet's go back to Notehub to make sure everything is working as expected.\n\nViewing Your Data\n\nOpen your web browser, return to Notehub, and open up your Sparrow project.\n\nClick Events to open your project's event list.\n\nOn the Events page locate the textbox to the right of the \u201cAll Devices\u201d dropdown. Type sensors.db in this textbox as a filter (see image below). If all went well, you should see one sensors.db event for each Reference Node you paired.\n\nOver time you'll see two additional types of events in Notehub.\n\nair.qo events report the temperature, humidity, and barometric pressure from the node's onboard BME280 environmental sensor. The nodes take hourly environmental readings by default.\n\nmotion.qo events report motion detected from the node's onboard PIR motion sensor.

The event's count reports the number of times the sensor detected motion since the previous motion.qo, and the event's total reports the number of times the sensor detected motion since the device was last reset.\n\nAnd with that, you have now completed the setup of your Sparrow Development Kit! Let's look at one more tip before you re-attach the backs of your Reference Node enclosures.\n\nDistinguishing Between Nodes\n\nEach reference node in your Sparrow Development Kit has a unique identifier. You can view this identifier in the File field of each of the node's air.qo and motion.qo events. For example, the screenshot below shows how to find a node's identifier on a motion.qo event. (You can double click the event to view the full identifier, and to copy the value to your clipboard.)\n\nHaving the identifier can be useful whenever you need to differentiate between multiple nodes\u2014aka whenever you need to tell which node is which.\n\nAs another option, you can also determine a node's identifier by pressing and releasing the node's PAIR button. Doing so creates and syncs a _health.qo event that contains the pressed node's identifier in its body.\n\nIf you'd like, make note of any of your nodes' identifiers using the steps above, and when you're ready, go ahead and re-attach the backs of your Reference Node enclosures.\n\nNext Steps\n\nNow that you have everything connected and communicating, this is what we recommend as next steps.\n\nMove your hardware to different locations. Go ahead and reposition your Essentials Board and Reference Nodes to get readings from different locations.\n\nNOTE: There are no hard-and-fast rules that dictate how far apart you can place LoRa devices because the optimal distance depends on whether your devices", "start_char_idx": 10580, "end_char_idx": 12532, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "91b7250f-6e29-40be-9980-6b2cb372fa54": {"__data__": {"id_": "91b7250f-6e29-40be-9980-6b2cb372fa54", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "", "category": "Sparrow Quickstart", "url": "https://dev.blues.io/quickstart/sparrow-quickstart/"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0160d4a5-478c-412c-8132-8e2a29e7cf3c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"title": "", "category": "Sparrow Quickstart", "url": "https://dev.blues.io/quickstart/sparrow-quickstart/"}, "hash": "a57fe818be2e618c4aa3358710ae560d84d9f513db397531b40bc9b6cfee997b"}, "2": {"node_id": "0795ffe9-3ec2-4fcc-89ec-1c7554016d18", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"title": "", "category": "Sparrow Quickstart", "url": "https://dev.blues.io/quickstart/sparrow-quickstart/"}, "hash": "c5b6ecec4c0447c811af1e62e737e3a462f5cfde584e89a820c1c8237d36ede3"}}, "hash": "481b15473a4b220e2080ec709e2a1b88ec1cee7362b6ddfc30f582d22ad8f153", "text": "far apart you can place LoRa devices because the optimal distance depends on whether your devices have a clear line-of-sight, or the signal needs to penetrate walls, concrete, and the like.
