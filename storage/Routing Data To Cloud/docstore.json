The tutorial below guides you through sending data to several popular services, and teaches you how to build visualizations using that data.\n\nGet started with:\nGeneral HTTP/HTTPS\n\nDon't see a cloud or backend that you need? Notehub is able to route data to virtually any provider. If you're having trouble setting up a route, reach out in our forum and we will help you out.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis tutorial should take approximately 30-40 minutes to complete.\n\nIn this tutorial, you'll learn how to connect your Notecard-powered app to General HTTP/HTTPS, and learn how to start creating simple visualizations with sensor data.\n\nThis tutorial assumes you've already completed the initial Sensor Tutorial to capture sensor data, saved it in a Notefile called sensors.qo, and sent that data through the Notecard to Notehub (or that you've already created your own app with sensor data and are ready to connect your app to external services).\n\nCreate a Route\n\nA Route is an external API, or server location, where Notes can be forwarded upon receipt.\n\nRoutes are defined in Notehub for a Project and can target Notes from one or more Fleets or all Devices. A Project can have multiple routes defined and active at any one time.\n\nBefore you create a Route, ensure the data you want to route is available in Notehub by navigating to the Events view.\n\nIn this tutorial you'll create a simple route to an HTTP/HTTPS endpoint.

To do this you'll use webhook.site, an online service that lets you create an HTTP endpoint and monitor all incoming requests.\n\nAfter getting your Notehub route working with webhook.site, switching a route to use a custom endpoint is as easy switching the URL. Let's see how it works.\n\nNavigate to webhook.site. When the page loads, you'll be presented with a unique URL that you can use as a Route destination. Copy that URL for the next step.\n\nNavigate to the Notehub.io project for which you want to create a route and click on the Routes menu item in the left nav.\n\nClick Create Route.\n\nSelect the General HTTP/HTTPS Request/Response route type.\n\nGive the route a name (for example, \"Health\").\n\nFor the Route URL, use the unique URL you obtained from webhook.site.\n\nIn the Notefiles dropdown, choose Select Notefiles and enter the name of the Notefile to monitor. For example, we used sensors.qo for the sensor tutorial.\n\nMake sure the Enabled switch remains selected, and click Create Route.\n\nReturn to webhook.site. This page will update automatically with data from your Notecard as it is received in Notehub. The data from your sensor is contained within the body attribute. Notice that Notehub provides you with a lot of information, by default. In the next section, we'll look at using transformations to customize what Notehub sends in a Route.\n\nUse JSONata to Transform JSON\n\nBefore moving on to routing data to another external service, let's briefly explore using JSONata to transform the data Notehub routes.\n\nAs mentioned above, Notehub provides a lot of information in each Route request. You may want to trim down what you send to the external service, or you might need to transform the payload to adhere to a format expected by that service.

Then, navigate back to your webhook.site url. As requests come in, you'll see your custom, JSONata-transformed payload in the Raw Content section.\n\nJSONata is simple, powerful, and flexible, and will come in handy as you create Routes for your external services. To explore JSONata further, visit our JSON Fundamentals guide.\n\nRoute to an External Service\n\nNow that you've created your first Route and learned how to use JSONata to shape the data sent by a Route, you'll connect Notehub to an external service.\n\nAnd because you've already set up a route to send data to webhook site, all you need to do to update a single URL.\n\nNavigate to the Routes page in Notehub and click the View button for your route.\n\nUpdate the URL to the location of the service or custom endpoint you're using.\n\nNote\n\nNotehub can route your data to multiple locations simultaneously.

And to do that you have several options.\n\nUsing a Platform\n\nThere are several platforms that help you build compelling visualizations, and you can easily route your data to these platforms from Notehub. If you're interested, check out our tutorials on the following platforms.\n\nAWS IoT Analytics\nAzure IoT Central\nDatacake\nGoogle Cloud Platform\nInitial State\nThingSpeak\nUbidots\nUsing a Charting Library\n\nIf you prefer to build your own visualizations from scratch, there are several high-quality JavaScript libraries for creating charts and graphs.\n\nChart.js\nHighcharts\nRecharts\nNext Steps\n\nCongratulations! You've created your first Route and connected your Notecard app to an external service.\n\nIf you're following the Blues Quickstart, you're done! But we do have some suggestions for next steps:\n\nBrowse the Blues Accelerators to find purpose-built, free and open source IoT solutions.\nBookmark the Notecard API for quick reference.\nFollow the Notehub Walkthrough to get more out of using Notehub.\n\nAt any time, if you find yourself stuck, please reach out on the community forum.\n\nCan we improve this page?
