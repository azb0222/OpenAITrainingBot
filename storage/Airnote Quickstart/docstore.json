For best performance, we recommend mounting the Airnote on the outside of an exterior window that gets a lot of sunlight. Using a window allows you to see real-time air quality readings on the included LCD display.\n\nIf you live in the Northern Hemisphere, use a south-facing window, if possible. If you live in the Southern Hemisphere, use a north-facing window.\n\nSeparate four of the included velcro Command Strips, and join the velcro sides together to make two pairs of strips. Remove the backing tape off of one side of each pair and place one above and one below the LCD screen on the back of the device. This is the side that you will want to be visible through a window.\n\nNext, remove the backing tape from the still exposed sides of the Command Strips and secure it to your preferred location. We've provided eight strips in total just in case you ever need to reposition the device.\n\nNote\n\nThe Airnote is not intended to be set directly on top of a solid surface!\n\nTo ensure that the Airnote has proper airflow for heat dissipation and sensor accuracy, the device includes a vented baseplate. This should not be obstructed and as such, we do not suggest placing the airnote on a table, railing or other non-porous surface.\n\nWatch the Self-Test And See Your First Reading\n\nOnce the Airnote is powered on, it begins a self-test sequence that is detailed in the Airnote Datasheet. This sequence may take a few minutes depending on the strength of cellular service in your area. Once completed, the screen on your device displays the current PM2.5 reading in micrograms per cubic meter air (or \u00b5g/m3), which you can customize in the next step.\n\nScan the QR Code and Customize Your Airnote\n\nNow, you're ready", "start_char_idx": 1725, "end_char_idx": 3564, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d7dd45d6-b181-434e-8d25-bcade97e0dbe": {"__data__": {"id_": "d7dd45d6-b181-434e-8d25-bcade97e0dbe", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "", "category": "Airnote Quickstart", "url": "https://dev.blues.io/datasheets/airnote/airnote-quickstart/"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3a20212e-7d81-42b8-a72f-9621daeb09a0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"title": "", "category": "Airnote Quickstart", "url": "https://dev.blues.io/datasheets/airnote/airnote-quickstart/"}, "hash": "2e5d15ca22597c58ad0bd3a84db31f3c6a76f12c1877d6c2bca14684a70aa2cf"}, "2": {"node_id": "8abbbb5b-8d34-4263-9249-3797fc2ac846", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"title": "", "category": "Airnote Quickstart", "url": "https://dev.blues.io/datasheets/airnote/airnote-quickstart/"}, "hash": "5fad8cc13f1c9010eed07066111e3448e802676543c15f1866225d1e811d10e4"}, "3": {"node_id": "036260b9-fb27-40cd-bc28-0980f1f813de", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"title": "", "category": "Airnote Quickstart", "url": "https://dev.blues.io/datasheets/airnote/airnote-quickstart/"}, "hash": "9fa0a17b832fb7fa846092775351a6f3daa5a44d74d8e1b35ef2bf8df0e7502c"}}, "hash": "75ad64903b6349478f2cd10296732a2f4f4deb30820055409835852fab1d8567", "text": "the QR Code and Customize Your Airnote\n\nNow, you're ready to customize your device.

PM10 is a mixture of materials that can include smoke, soot, dust, salt, acids, and metals. Particulate matter also forms when gases emitted from motor vehicles and industrial machinery undergo chemical reactions in the atmosphere.\n\nPM2.5\n\nFine inhalable particles, with diameters 2.5 micrometers and smaller. Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is an air pollutant that is a concern for people's health when levels in air are high. PM2.5 are tiny particles in the air that reduce visibility and cause the air to appear hazy when levels are elevated. Outdoor PM2.5 levels are most likely to be elevated on days with little or no wind or air mixing.\n\nPM1.0\n\nDescribed as extremely fine particulate matter, PM1.0 is much less frequently talked about, as there is little available data. However, it is believed to have even more significant health impacts than PM2.5 and PM10. However, scientists still aren't clear about the health implications of these particles.\n\nEPA Standards (December 14th, 2012)\nPM\tSafe Levels (\u00b5g/m\u00b3)\n1.0 (24-hrs)\t--\n1.0 (Annual)\t--\n2.5 (24-hrs)\t35\n2.5 (Annual)\t12\n10 (24-hrs)\t150\n10 (Annual)\t50*\n\n* Originally set at 50 \u00b5g/m\u00b3, the annual PM10 standard was revoked because of a lack of evidence establishing a link between long-term exposure to coarse", "start_char_idx": 5532, "end_char_idx": 7051, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4e74d3c3-fe39-4a5c-a66a-147e036612bf": {"__data__": {"id_": "4e74d3c3-fe39-4a5c-a66a-147e036612bf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "", "category": "Airnote Quickstart", "url": "https://dev.blues.io/datasheets/airnote/airnote-quickstart/"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3a20212e-7d81-42b8-a72f-9621daeb09a0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"title": "", "category": "Airnote Quickstart", "url": "https://dev.blues.io/datasheets/airnote/airnote-quickstart/"}, "hash": "2e5d15ca22597c58ad0bd3a84db31f3c6a76f12c1877d6c2bca14684a70aa2cf"}, "2": {"node_id": "036260b9-fb27-40cd-bc28-0980f1f813de", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"title": "", "category": "Airnote Quickstart", "url": "https://dev.blues.io/datasheets/airnote/airnote-quickstart/"}, "hash": "9fa0a17b832fb7fa846092775351a6f3daa5a44d74d8e1b35ef2bf8df0e7502c"}, "3": {"node_id": "0f2cf108-1cc9-40a3-824b-b7c7ad7fdc6e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"title": "", "category": "Airnote Quickstart", "url": "https://dev.blues.io/datasheets/airnote/airnote-quickstart/"}, "hash": "712c7f092fa2b18b4dbafa295d3bef0166e019e17b714924461cd4f2601cba20"}}, "hash": "8f36bb34a4ae50d9ca939b8380b0635223d86744550c19668a67593c45918d81", "text": "because of a lack of evidence establishing a link between long-term exposure to coarse particles and health problems.\n\nNOTE: The information regarding particulate matter, and its effects, has been taken in whole or part from EPA.gov: Particulate Matter (PM) Basics and kaiterra: A Guide to Understanding Particulate Matter (PM).\n\nFAQ\n\nFor other questions, issues deploying your device, or to share a photo of your Airnote in its new home, visit the Blues Forum.\n\nHow can I manually charge my Airnote?\n\nYour Airnote should have enough charge out of the box to function and fully charge the battery using the onboard solar panel. If, however, your Airnote needs a manual charge, you can do so with a Micro USB cable.\n\nRemove the rear bottom panel from the Airnote and plug a Micro USB cable into the Micro USB port on the edge of the board next to the solar panel.\n\nIf the Airnote is off when you plug it in, you won't see any visual indication that the device is charging, even though it is. If the device has been switched on, the LCD display will update to indicate that the device is charging. When the plus (+) sign on the display disappears, the Airnote is charged and ready to mount.\n\nOnce the battery has charged, place the bottom panel back on the Airnote and secure the panel with the two included Phillips screws.\n\nHow do I know my Airnote is charging?\n\nIf the Airnote is off when plugged into USB, you won't see any visual indication that the device is charging, even though it is. If the device is on, you can use the built-in LCD panel to monitor the charging process.\n\nWhen the Airnote is plugged-in via USB, place it on a flat surface with the LCD screen facing up.

Move the Airnote to a location with more sunlight, or charge the device over USB.\n\nWhy is my Airnote showing the letters \"CL\"?\n\nAfter the Airnote runs through its self-test sequence, it attempts to connect to a cellular tower to obtain the time. Until it obtains the time, \"CL\" is displayed to indicate that the Airnote is waiting for clock time in order to begin capturing air quality readings.\n\nWhy is my Airnote flashing a plus sign (\"+\")?\n\nThe plus sign indicates that the Airnote is performing a network operation. A flashing plus sign indicates that cellular or GPS is on, and a fast-flash means that the Airnote is connected to the cloud and is", "start_char_idx": 8878, "end_char_idx": 10673, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5ec54fc4-2aca-457c-85cb-ef2a08cb8544": {"__data__": {"id_": "5ec54fc4-2aca-457c-85cb-ef2a08cb8544", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "", "category": "Airnote Quickstart", "url": "https://dev.blues.io/datasheets/airnote/airnote-quickstart/"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3a20212e-7d81-42b8-a72f-9621daeb09a0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"title": "", "category": "Airnote Quickstart", "url": "https://dev.blues.io/datasheets/airnote/airnote-quickstart/"}, "hash": "2e5d15ca22597c58ad0bd3a84db31f3c6a76f12c1877d6c2bca14684a70aa2cf"}, "2": {"node_id": "0f2cf108-1cc9-40a3-824b-b7c7ad7fdc6e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"title": "", "category": "Airnote Quickstart", "url": "https://dev.blues.io/datasheets/airnote/airnote-quickstart/"}, "hash": "712c7f092fa2b18b4dbafa295d3bef0166e019e17b714924461cd4f2601cba20"}}, "hash": "bd39ae2b955c2ff17b567287e561353bcf114f7b90e9651437b7adecebc665e2", "text": "on, and a fast-flash means that the Airnote is connected to the cloud and is syncing.\n\nWhy is my airnote displaying a colon character (\":\") on the screen?\n\nIf you see this on the screen, it means that the Airnote couldn't find a cellular tower the last time it tried to sync. Move the device to another location and try again.\n\nDo I need to update the Airnote firmware or activate the device?\n\nNo. The Airnote is a pre-configured cellular-powered device. You don't need to do anything to activate it other than turning it on, and there's no need to update the firmware on the device in order to use it.\n\nWhat air quality sensors does the Airnote use?\n\nFor details about the onboard sensors, see the Airnote Datasheet.\n\nIn which countries can the Airnote operate?\n\nThe Airnote's built-in cellular connection works in over 135 countries. For the complete list, see the Notecard datasheet.\n\nWhat does the value in the Serial Number field represent?\n\nThe Airnote is populated with a unique serial number string during activation. The string is auto-generated using three random words, separated by hyphens.\n\nWhy does the LCD screen turn off?\n\nThe Airnote's LCD screen shuts off if voltage is too low. Make sure to position your Airnote in a location that receives enough sunlight to charge the device, or manually charge your Airnote.\n\nWhy don't I see data on the dashboard at the same rate data is collected?\n\nBy default the Airnote collects data every 30 minutes, and you can configure that rate on your device's dashboard.\n\nThe Airnote transmits collected data every 60 minutes, however the transmission rate can vary based on the device's battery level. If your device is not transmitting data, you can try checking its current voltage, and manually charging if necessary.\n\nCan we improve this page?
