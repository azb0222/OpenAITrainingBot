Minimizing latency typically comes at a trade-off in power draw (and potentially data usage - depending on your use case). However, when configured correctly, the Notecard will be opened to a whole new realm of possibilities.\n\nOverview\n\nWhen modeling the flow of information between a Notecard and Notehub.io, you must first take into consideration the following maxim...\n\nAll synchronization operations are initiated from the device in a \"push/pull\" manner; the service is passive.\n\nWhen you begin to think of a transaction in this manner, the capabilities and limitations of operations will become obvious. As a result, you will gain an intuitive understanding of what steps must occur in order to achieve your desired outcome.\n\nAbove, the Notecard is operating in continuous mode with sync set to true. This configuration initiates two separate, simultaneous connections; one dedicated to Note delivery and the other dedicated to notifications.\n\nDatabase Connection\n\nAs previously stated, any time the Notecard and Notehub communicate, that communication must be initiated by the Notecard. Therefore, in order for the Notecard to gather new information from Notehub.io, the Notecard would need to issue requests to Notehub.io. The frequency of this polling request interval is specified by using the inbound parameter.\n\nIdeally, you wish for the synchronization to occur as close as possible to the moment any data changes. In order to minimize latency by using the inbound parameter alone, the interval must be specified to be as small as possible.

However, doing so would ultimately result in great inefficiencies for both data usage and power draw.\n\nFortunately, this limitation can be overcome by the introduction of a secondary communication channel dedicated exclusively to notifications.\n\nNotification Connection\n\nProviding Notehub.io with a mechanism to alert the Notecard of new Notes, while still initiating the transaction from the Notecard itself, has a more elegant and simple solution than you may have guessed.\n\nWhen sync is set to true, the Notecard establishes a secondary connection, one dedicated to the notification of new Notes. This connection utilizes HTTP long polling to request the set of changes, and the server will only respond once changes become available. Now, when the Notecard becomes aware of any new Notes, it can immediately synchronize the Note queues on the primary connection.\n\nConfiguring Notehub Interactions\n\nTo configure your Notecard to use this secondary connection, you must send a hub.set request with the following values.\n\nhub.set Request\nCOPY\n{\n  \"req\": \"hub.set\",\n  \"mode\": \"continuous\",\n  \"sync\": true,\n  \"inbound\": <Number: polling interval in minutes>\n}\nmode: \"continuous\" Parameter\n\nOnce mode is set to continuous, a continuous connection is established between the Notecard and Notehub.io. Maintaining a continuous connection requires significantly more power than polling at a periodic interval, but the Notecard will have much faster response times as a result. A continuous connection prevents the Notecard from being required to power on, connect to a cellular tower (or a Wi-Fi access point for the Wi-Fi Notecard), and open a connection to Notehub.io with each transaction.

Then, the Notecard will issue a request for changes over the primary connection, and pull the new Notes from Notehub.io to the Notecard. Once they have arrived on the Notecard, then they can be operated on by your program.\n\nIf your application can benefit from knowing as soon as information becomes available on Notehub.io, then utilizing sync:true is the most efficient way to expedite Note arrival.

Therefore, minimizing the latency on an outbound transaction is much more simple because the Notecard controls the connection.\n\nnote.add Request\n\nThe easiest way to send low-latency outbound data from the Notecard is with the note.add request, making sure to set the request's sync parameter to true.\n\nWhen sync is set to true, the Notecard will immediately send the queued changes to Notehub.io.

The web.post request sends data directly to a proxy Route in Notehub, and does not store your data in a Notefile.\n\nBecause the web.post request skips the processing associated with storing and retrieving data, it runs faster than note.add.

Signals transmit fast because they are not stored in Notefiles, and do not appear as events in Notehub. Because of these processing efficiencies, signals are the fastest way to send inbound data from Notehub to a Notecard.\n\nWarning\n\nSignals are only sent to devices that are actively connected to Notehub.

You can do this by wiring the Notecard's AUXEN pin to its 3V3 pin.\nSend a hub.set request to the Notecard, ensuring you set the \"mode\" to \"continuous\", and \"sync\" to true.\nSend a {\"req\": \"card.aux.serial\",\"mode\": \"notify,signals\"} request to the Notecard, which tells the Notecard to", "start_char_idx": 9098, "end_char_idx": 10542, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "70dd1b86-1331-426b-b5d5-eeb7d78e1dcf": {"__data__": {"id_": "70dd1b86-1331-426b-b5d5-eeb7d78e1dcf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "", "category": "Minimizing Latency", "url": "https://dev.blues.io/guides-and-tutorials/notecard-guides/minimizing-latency/"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5503cf94-573a-4fd7-bf68-ac8958c6112e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"title": "", "category": "Minimizing Latency", "url": "https://dev.blues.io/guides-and-tutorials/notecard-guides/minimizing-latency/"}, "hash": "d1eeecdc16bb8d6d1e5be1b5f9399b80e14a662ec786935fe29d1b8e775c5622"}, "2": {"node_id": "04cb53f7-ff65-4999-b587-907dea38acf0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"title": "", "category": "Minimizing Latency", "url": "https://dev.blues.io/guides-and-tutorials/notecard-guides/minimizing-latency/"}, "hash": "fe28eeb1fb6ac03c8687341cbfc41f9a33ab4959dc447b19439d3ac1d4c65575"}}, "hash": "cf8de6cf81cf3ed713a2588f98d57a41b8fe33eb731d9b2730f592a2dbd5f5d1", "text": "request to the Notecard, which tells the Notecard to start streaming incoming signals to AUXRX / AUXTX.\n\nWith these steps complete, the Notecard will automatically detect incoming signals and stream them to your host device's TX / RX pins for further processing.\n\nOption #2: ATTN\n\nAs a second option, you can configure your Notecard to perform an interrupt every time it receives a new signal. To set this workflow up you need to complete the following steps.\n\nWire a Notecard's ATTN pin to a GPIO pin on your host. If you want your host to only wake on incoming signals, connect ATTN to your host's EN pin.\nSend a hub.set request to the Notecard, ensuring you set the \"mode\" to \"continuous\", and \"sync\" to true.\nSend a {\"req\": \"card.attn\", \"mode\": \"arm,signal\"} request to the Notecard. This configures the Notecard so that ATTN wakes up the host when it receives an inbound signal.\nWhen the host receives the interrupt, send a {\"req\": \"hub.signal\"} request to the Notecard to dequeue the signal. The signals comes back in \"body\":{\"your-key\":\"your-value\"} format.\n\nIf there are multiple signals to process, the response will include \"signals\": N, where N is the number of signals remaining.\n\nWith these steps complete, the Notecard will detect incoming signals, queue them in memory, and disarm the ATTN pin to alert the host to process the signal.\n\nAdditional Resources\nhub.set\nnote.add\nCan we improve this page?
