By designing your solution along a small set of size and performance constraints, you retain the flexibility to upgrade to newer devices, or swap between radio access technologies based on deployment location.\n\nAs detailed in our host system design guide, Notecard-based products should be designed with an M.2 Key E connector and secured to a grounded standoff with mounting screw. In future designs, although the M.2 mounting screw and standoff will stay in the same location, the Notecard's length may be extended by up to 7mm (from today's 35mm to 42mm) to account for enhanced or additional components including, in some configurations, an RF antenna.\n\nEnd product designs that wish to incorporate these future Notecards with enhanced functionality will need account for the 42mm board length, and should ensure that there is a 4mm keep-out area around the Notecard that extends in a cylinder around the far edge of the board. Meaning, for the area starting at the standoff and extending approximately 8mm, ideally there should be no ground plane, no metal screws, no metal components, and no metal enclosure.\n\nIn addition, regardless of whether a future Notecard is the current length of 35mm or longer, designers should not make assumptions about the location of the the u.FL connectors on the Notecard. Specifically, the u.FL connectors in all future notecards may shift to being at the far outer edge of the Notecard PCB instead of the right edge where they are located today. As such, customers are encouraged to source u.FL cables with enough additional length to ensure that they can reach the u.FL connectors at the far edge of the boards.\n\nCustomers with existing Notecard-based designs will be able to continue to", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1842, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3c6d83bf-3703-4c14-95f3-cfc0e66100ec": {"__data__": {"id_": "3c6d83bf-3703-4c14-95f3-cfc0e66100ec", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "", "category": "Future Proofing Notecard Based Designs", "url": "https://dev.blues.io/datasheets/application-notes/future-proofing-notecard-based-designs/"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f069ce99-bc22-46c6-9620-bf04df75a732", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"title": "", "category": "Future Proofing Notecard Based Designs", "url": "https://dev.blues.io/datasheets/application-notes/future-proofing-notecard-based-designs/"}, "hash": "7f3c6ced2bbae379f47d84053065fee16e79ade34bba9ae93e4d4d380e317969"}, "2": {"node_id": "938d64dc-8563-4f7e-99a2-b6b9068f3584", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"title": "", "category": "Future Proofing Notecard Based Designs", "url": "https://dev.blues.io/datasheets/application-notes/future-proofing-notecard-based-designs/"}, "hash": "5b387543084ad1421be7cb15792da970ca44bf1ca62dd1b07a138cfceb3ab609"}}, "hash": "a1fc4205f75f44f41c3e04003233498385c544ab74e076bb4b3e53991d5b81c9", "text": "with existing Notecard-based designs will be able to continue to acquire and use existing Notecard variants and do not need to explicitly revise existing designs unless they are already planning an enhancement to their product.
